1. Insert your SIM card into your new phone and turn it on. Then connect to Wi-Fi. During the start up process, you’ll get a popup asking if you’d like to copy apps & data from an old phone. Select A backup from an Android phone. 
2. On your old phone, open the Settings app, then select Google. 
3. Still using your old phone, select Set up and restore. Then, select Set up nearby device. Your phone will now search for nearby devices. 
4. Select your new phone’s model name from the list.  
5. Tap “Next” and then confirm the screen lock for your old phone. Then, tap Copy.
6. On your new phone, sign into your Google account and then confirm the screen lock of your old phone again (this time on the new device).  
7. Finally, tap “Restore” to transfer your data to your new phone.  

And you’re done! As you can see, there are a few steps involved in the process, but it’s easy to transfer data between Android phones once you know how. The method will vary slightly depending on the devices you’re using, but luckily Google makes it easy to follow along thanks to their on-screen instructions.
